Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, 
it is created. If it exists, it is neither truncated (as opposed to 'w'),
 nor the call to this function fails (as is the case with 'x'). 
 The file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file. 
 This may be useful if it's desired to get an advisory lock (see flock()) 
 before attempting to modify the file, as using 'w' could truncate the 
 file before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, ftruncate() 
 can be used after the
 lock is requested).
