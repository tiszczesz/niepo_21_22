Different operating system families have different line-ending conventions. 
When you write a text file and want to insert a line break, you need to use the
 correct line-ending character(s) for your operating system. Unix based systems 
 use \n as the line ending character, Windows based systems use \r\n as the line ending 
 characters and Macintosh based systems (Mac OS Classic) used \r as the 
line ending character.
